# Gesture-based music tool

This toy demo was made over an afternoon (and subsequent night) for MHacks 2024. As such, the code is absolutely disgusting and is probably the least efficient and readable thing I've written in some time.

It uses Google's [Mediapipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/tree/master) for the hand tracking.

Try it out [here](https://hand-music.vercel.app/).
